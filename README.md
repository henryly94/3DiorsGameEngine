## Part 1 ObjLoader/Transforamtion

### Overview
This project is based on sample code on [LWJGL](https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook/tree/master/chapter07).
What I am trying to implement here is the ObjLoader.java/Transformation.java. In the ObjLoader, I wrote the function to
read in .obj format files as GL Object. Tricky part here is to deal with files in different condition. Because a .obj file
is allowed to omit some unnecessary parts of information.


## Part 2 SceneManager & ScriptLoader
